3dArray
=======

A viewable 3D array of "breathing" spheres using WebGL.

I spent a couple of days 2 summers ago messing around with WebGL. I had no previous experience with WebGL at the time, and minimal JavaScript experience. The result was a 10x10x10 3D array of "breathing" spheres. If an individual sphere is clicked on by the mouse, its "breathing" pattern will be reversed. The view can be rotated and moved, and zoomed in and out.

JavaScript libraries
====================

Three.js/three.min.js - Used as WebGL renderer, API that simplifies code

TrackballControls.js -  Used for camera controls, zooming in and out, rotating the 3D array
